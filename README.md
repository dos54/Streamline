"It is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance" - Doctrine and Covenants 131:6
""Human beings are distinguished from other animals by their highly developed telencephalon, their opposable thumb, and by their freedom. Free is the state of one who has freedom. Freedom is a word that nourishes the human dream, that no one can explain and no one cannot understand." - [Ilha das Flores documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8xT5q4ahE)
