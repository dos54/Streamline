""Human beings are distinguished from other animals by their highly developed telencephalon, their opposable thumb, and by their freedom. Free is the state of one who has freedom. Freedom is a word that nourishes the human dream, that no one can explain and no one cannot understand." - [Ilha das Flores documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8xT5q4ahE)

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).
